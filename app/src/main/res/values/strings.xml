    <!-- Note to language dude or dame —
        Each array lists things Srini might say in the contexts described one by one below.
        App will pick one option at random at any given time. You can include as many different 
        "lines" as come to mind, or as few as one. Each line should be natural, casual, &
        idiomatic. What would a young adult or teenager say to a slightly younger person in these
        contexts in the language and culture You working with? --> 
    <!-- You can include alternatives from different dialects, as long as each line can be
        generally understood by all speakers of the language at large. --> 
    <!-- Some lines is used more often than others in real life. You can get Srini to use certain
        lines more than others by including the more common lines more than once (in the relevant
        array). -->

    <string-array name="story1">
        <item>There once was a speedy Hare who bragged about how fast he could run. Tired of hearing him boast, the Tortoise challenged him to a race.</item>
        <item>All the animals in the forest gathered to watch. </item>
        <item>The Hare ran down the road for a while and then and paused to rest. </item>
        <item>He looked back at the tortoise and cried out, "How do you expect to win this race when you are walking along at your slow, slow pace?"</item>
        <item>The Hare stretched himself out alongside the road and fell asleep, thinking, "There is plenty of time to relax."</item>
        <item>The Tortoise walked and walked; never ever stopping until he came to the finish line.</item>
        <item>The animals who were watching cheered so loudly for Tortoise, that they woke up Hare. </item>
        <item>The Hare stretched and yawned and began to run again, but it was too late. Tortoise was already over the line.</item>
        <item>MORAL: Slow and steady wins the race.</item>

        <item>The crow tried to push his head into the jug. Sadly, he found that the neck of the jug was too narrow.</item>
        <item>Then he tried to push the jug to tilt for the water to flow out but the jug was too heavy.</item>
        <item>The crow thought hard for a while. Then looking around it, he saw some pebbles.</item>
        <item>he suddenly had a good idea.</item>
        <item>he started picking up the pebbles one by one, dropping each into the jug. </item>
        <item>As more and more pebbles filled the jug, the water level kept rising.</item>
        <item>Soon it was high enough for the crow to drink.</item>

    <string-array name="story4">
        <item>Once when a lion, the king of the jungle, was asleep, a little mouse began running up and down on him. This soon awakened the lion, who placed his huge paw on the mouse, and opened his big jaws to swallow him.</item>
        <item>"Pardon, O King!" cried the little Mouse, "Forgive me this time. I shall never repeat it and I shall never forget your kindness. And who knows, I may be able to do you a good turn one of these days!”</item>
        <item>The Lion was so tickled by the idea of the mouse being able to help him that he lifted his paw and let him go.</item>
        <item>Sometime later, a few hunters captured the lion, and tied him to a tree. After that they went in search of a wagon, to take him to the zoo.</item>
        <item>Just then the little mouse happened to pass by. On seeing the lion/’s plight, he ran up to him and gnawed away the ropes that bound him, the king of the jungle.</item>
        <item>"Was I not right?" said the little mouse, very happy to help the lion.</item>
